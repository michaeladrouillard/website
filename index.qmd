I am an M.I student at the University of Toronto.

I study data science, and I'm also interested in AI alignment.

At one point, the International Flipper Pinball Association said that I was [91st in Quebec](https://www.ifpapinball.com/tournaments/view.php?t=18466) at pinball. Apparently I haven't played enough games to stay on the leaderboard. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
